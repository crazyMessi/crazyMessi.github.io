<!-- <img src="images/self.jpg" alt="Zhuodong Li" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 10px;"> -->

I'm a M.S. student in Computer Graphics at the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). My research interests include computer graphics, point cloud processing, mesh processing, and geometric modeling.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Fei Hou](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~houf/index.html) from the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

I received my B.S. degree in Digital Media Technology from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2023. 

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position for fall 2026 enrollment.

My primary research focus during graduate studies was point cloud orientation, specifically determining normal orientation consistency for non-watertight point clouds. Related work has been accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025 and published in ACM Transactions on Graphics. I aspire to leverage my experience in geometric processing to tackle challenges in 3D generation during my doctoral studies. I may also pursue other graphics-related domains such as 3D reconstruction and geometric processing.
